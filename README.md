# Manabu

Manabu is a web application backed by Node.js that makes learning competitive.

## How does it work?

The project is centralized around the observation that students who are more engaged and entertained (shoutout to Kahoot.it, that was a huge inspiration) retain information better and longer. Manabu incorporates the competitiveness of multiplayer gaming to create a more engaging learning experience.

## How can I contribute?

The development of Manabu is currently closed-source but as the project becomes more polished and established, contribution will be open.
