# Manabu

![Homepage screenshot](screenshot.png "Screenshot")


Manabu is a web application backed by Node.js that makes learning competitive.

## How does it work?

The project is centralized around the observation that students who are more engaged and entertained (shoutout to Kahoot.it, that was a huge inspiration) retain information better and longer. Manabu incorporates the competitiveness of multiplayer gaming to create a more engaging learning experience.

The actual project is made with Node.js using the ExpressJS framework. The back-end of the site is handled with Firebase Cloud Hosting and client-to-server interactions are handled with Socket.io. 

## How to use Manabu

I plan to host the project online soon, but for now:

```
git clone https://github.com/isaacaddis/Manabu
cd Manabu
npm start
```
